      "The team had its humble origins in 2013 as a group of elementary school students interested in robotics. We started our journey with the FIRST Lego League in third grade, competing against other teams with robots built our of LEGOs. As we developed our technical skillset and learned how to work together, we progressed as a team to the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). In a larger competition with more advanced tasks, the robots are now built from a mix of off-the shelf and custom-made partsâ€” no longer the simple LEGO machines from before.",
